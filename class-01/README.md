# Class 01: SMACSS and Responsive Web Design

## Overview

Today we will be covering some new topics and reviewing concepts you should already be familiar with. For students who completed Code 201, today should be a review of CSS floats.

We will spend some time reviewing the concepts from the lab 00 assignments. We will also discuss several new and very important topics, including state, scope, and the "new" keyword.

- Gain an understanding of scope with arrow functions and with the use of `let` and `const` in place of `var`
- Gain an understanding of context, scope, "this", and the "new" keyword
